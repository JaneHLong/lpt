<title>Logic</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>As noted in the preface, one useful definition of mathematics is the body of knowledge obtained by applying logic (deductive and inductive) to a system of axioms. Our first thought is to deal with things which conform to a bivalent system of logic; that is, things which are either true or false.</p>
