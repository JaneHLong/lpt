<title>Sets</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>A certain amount of mathematical maturity is necessary to find and study applications of abstract algebra.  A basic knowledge of set theory, mathematical induction, equivalence relations, and matrices is a must.  Even more important is the ability to read and understand mathematical proofs.  In this chapter we will outline the background needed for a course in abstract algebra.</p>
